Officially, the software produced by NIH/NCATS is called “G-SRS” (Global Substance Registration System). It is most correct to say that “G-SRS” is the “software to support the GINAS initiative”. Unofficially, “GINAS” is often used interchangeably with G-SRS to refer to the software. "
                                    "A major goal of the G-SRS software is to support the ISO 11238 requirements of the IDMP standard."
